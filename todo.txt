Things to do in vague order of importance:
SHORT TERM THINGS TO DO:

change gameloop script in to a class that can be initialized.

LONG TERM GOALS:

make sure that python/scipy/pyopengl are compatable and running on both machines

determine how to run rendering loop. Probably involves research in to PyOpenGL

determine class structure, and how each will communicate. general ideas:
	space contains:
		particles (accelerated by force field)
		force field over all space(can be zero. generated by generators OR can be preset)
		field generators(can be null ie. field can be preset)

	game loop (calls update on space and all the things it contains, and potentially calls update on objects directly. depends on how the code works.)
